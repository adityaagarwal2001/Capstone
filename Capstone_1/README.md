# Kickstarter - what separates successful campaign from failed one?

Crowdfunding is very crowded space in present day where Kickstarter and Indiegogo hold the most market share. My goal is to identify factors for a successful campaign. Successful campaign is one where 'pledged' money (money raised) is greater than or equal to 'goal' (money asked/requested) within a given deadline.
